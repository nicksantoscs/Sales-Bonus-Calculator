# Sales-Bonus-Calculator
A Windows Form application used to calculate sales bonus for employees. Each employee is supposed to make 2% of their total sales.
The form app can change the language to French, or Portuguese.
This was an assignment completed for my COMP-1098 class, where I scored a 108.27% on this assignment.
